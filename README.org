* What is this?
[[https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl][gallery-dl]] is a command-line program to download image galleries and collections from, among others, deviantArt.

This is a sample configuration that uses postprocessors to format the metadata into HTML pages and link them together, as well as download emojis and avatars, display the comments, and generate a gallery view. The goal is to have a functional archive of a user's posts in the event that deviantArt goes offline.

This contains the following files:
- =config.json=: relevant configuration for gallery-dl.
- =gallery-dl-deviantart.py=: metadata formatter called by gallery-dl.
- =gallery-dl-deviantart-postprocessing.py=: executable formatter called by gallery-dl.
- =gallery-dl-deviantart-index.py=: extra script to call manually to generate the gallery view.

* How to use

** Requirements
- =gallery-dl=
- =beautifulsoup4=

** Gallery-dl configuration
[[file:config.json]] shows the relevant settings.

*** Paths
Since the postprocessors are linking files together, the result depends on a specific file hierarchy.
- all deviations/journal posts/scraps are downloaded into =deviantart/images=
- all metadata are downloaded into =deviantart/html=
- files are named ={username}_{date:%Y%m%d}_{title!g}.{extension}=
The parts where assumptions about the file hierarchy are hard-coded in the code are marked with a =# VARIABLE= comment.

*** Postprocessors
=Gallery-dl= runs two postprocessors after downloading each image:
- a metadata processor, that saves the collected metadata into =../html/{username}_{date:%Y%m%d}_{title!g}.html= (relative to the downloaded image), with the format given by the string returned by =gallery-dl-deviantart.main()=.
- after the image is written, another postprocessor runs the command =python gallery-dl-deviantart-postprocessing.py {_path} {_directory} {_filename} {username}= to modify the URLs in the metadata file (and the deviation if it's not an image).

** Run gallery-dl
It's not possible to use an absolute path for the metadata module ([[https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/issues/3399][issue #3399]]), meaning that =gallery-dl-deviantart.py= needs to be in the python path. Then the next module is called by =python gallery-dl-deviantart-postprocessing.py=.

For simplicity, I keep all files in =~/.config/gallery-dl/= and use them the following way:
#+begin_src bash
pushd ~/.config/gallery-dl/
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) gallery-dl -p $(pass deviantart) https://www.deviantart.com/$user
python gallery-dl-deviantart-index.py ~/archive/deviantart
#+end_src

** URL replacement
The =gallery-dl-deviantart-postprocessing.py= processor tries to replace in all HTML files:
- the links to the same deviantArt profile
- the images embedded in metadata text (typically avatars and emojis). They are downloaded in the =assets= subdirectory.

Each processors run for each individual image, so on the first run, you might see in the output many occurrences of =No candidates for https://www.deviantart.com/...=. This means that the last downloaded deviation has a link to another, which hasn't been downloaded yet so it cannot find its current path. You should run =gallery-dl= a second time with the =--no-skip= option so the postprocessor can look again for the linked files.

Once this processor is done, the only external resource should be the [[https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css][simple.css]] stylesheet.

** Screenshots
The HTML alone should be usable, but for a nicer output I included the [[https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css][simple.css]] stylesheet (in dark or light mode depending on your browser settings).

A deviation with comments (zoomed out):
[[file:screenshots/deviation.png]]

All pages have the same template:
- Deviation title
  - Author avatar
  - Date with link to online version
  - Categories
  - Statistics on comments and favorites
- Image if applicable (otherwise falls back on a thumbnail if available)
- Description if it is a deviation
- Text excerpt for journals and textual deviations, with a link to the full version
- Threaded comments

The index page:
[[file:screenshots/index.png]]
Template:
- 3-columns grid of all images, ordered chronologically (no pagination)
- Journals and textual deviations are shown by their title
- Clicking on an element calls the metadata page
